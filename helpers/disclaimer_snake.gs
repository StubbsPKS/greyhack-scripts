// DISCLAIMER - PLEASE READ
// A significant portion of this script is taken from https://github.com/psimonson/greyhack-scripts/blob/master/v0.8/new/sh.src
// The plan is to look there for the bare minimum I need to get up and running with a shell-style program and then build 
// the rest of the tools myself, especially anything complex.
// So a HUGE shout out and thanks to 5n4k3
