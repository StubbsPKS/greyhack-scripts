# GreyHack-Scripts
This repository will host scripts that I have written for the game, Grey Hack. Some of these scripts may be based partially on the work of other players and any script that uses ideas or code snippets from another player will have credits added for that player (included repo links when I can find them).

## Contributing
If you spot something that needed fixing or have an idea for an additional feature, please feel free to open an issue on this repository or submit a pull request. 

If you don't feel comfortable opening your own PR, please leave the feedback as an issue here in Github I'll be more than happy to talk through your idea and see if and how we can get it incorporated into the project.

## Special Thanks
* I have been using the [greyscript_compiler](https://github.com/anarrak/greyscript_compiler) created by anarrakto to avoid having to copy and paste common functions into every script.
* I got started with the creation of my shell tool by looking through [code](https://github.com/psimonson/greyhack-scripts/tree/master/v0.8) written by Philip R. Simonson (aka 5n4k3), so many thanks to 5n4k3 for the initial push to get my shell code started.



## NOTICES
### This is not Real Life
Grey Hack is a **GAME** and none of the code in this repository can be used for any actual real world cyber security purposes.
Many code comments or output strings may be written in a way that indicates otherwise, but that is purely for immersion in the game world.

### Use of code
These scripts and other code snippets are free to use and modify as you see fit. The only thing I ask is that if you use a code from any of the tools or scripts in this repo that you include a link back here in your code comments, thanks!
